  SolidUI
 </h1>
</p>

This is an unofficial port of [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) & [tremor-raw](https://github.com/tremorlabs/tremor-raw) to [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/).

> **Note:** This is a fork of a fork of solid-ui, adapted for usage with Tailwind v4 and published under the `@doubleprecision` npm scope.

Accessible and customizable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Free. Open Source. **Use this to build your own component library**.

## Usage

Instead of using the original `solid-ui` CLI, use the scoped version to initialize and add components to your project:

```bash
bunx @doubleprecision/solidui-cli@latest init
bunx @doubleprecision/solidui-cli@latest add button
```

_Or using your preferred package manager (e.g., `bunx`, `pnpm dlx`, `yarn dlx`)._
